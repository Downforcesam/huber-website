              Cusco: Gateway to the Andes
            </h1>
            <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-700">
              Nestled high in the Andes mountains of Peru, at an elevation of
              over 3,400 meters (11,000 feet), lies the historic city of Cusco.
              Once the capital of the mighty Inca Empire, Cusco is now a vibrant
              cultural hub and a gateway to some of the most iconic

                  Cusco's rich tapestry of history and heritage is evident in
                  its cobblestone streets, colonial architecture, and ancient
                  Inca ruins. The city's UNESCO World Heritage-listed historic
                  center is a treasure trove of architectural gems, including
                  the majestic Cathedral of Santo Domingo, the exquisite
                  Coricancha (Temple of the Sun), and the ornate Church of San
                  Blas. Visitors can wander through colorful markets, explore
                  artisan workshops, and immerse themselves in the indigenous
                  Quechua culture that thrives in the city's bustling plazas and
