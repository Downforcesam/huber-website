  "testimonial": "We wanted something off the beaten path for our honeymoon, and [Guide Name] delivered beyond our wildest dreams. The Choquequirao trek was challenging but incredibly rewarding. Our guide's knowledge of the local culture, history, and hidden spots made every day an adventure. The home stay with a local family was a highlight - we learned to cook traditional meals and felt like part of the family. We can't recommend [Guide Name] enough for anyone looking for an authentic Peruvian adventure!",
